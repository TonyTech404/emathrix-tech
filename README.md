# Emathrix Technologies

This is the repository for the Emathrix Technologies website built with AstroWind - a free and open-source template based on Astro 5.0 and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview

The website is built with:
- **[Astro 5.0](https://astro.build/)**: A modern static site builder
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: For utility-first styling
- SEO optimized structure
- Dark mode support
- Fast and optimized for performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18.17.1, 20.3.0, or 21.0.0+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd astrowind
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:4321

## Branch Structure

The project uses the following branch structure:

- **main**: Production-ready code, the source of the live website
- **gh-pages**: Automatically generated by the deployment workflow, contains the built site

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main` for any new work:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and test locally using `npm run dev`

3. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add a descriptive message about your changes"
   ```

4. Push your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Create a Pull Request to merge your changes into `main`

## Build and Deployment

### Local Build

To build the site locally:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `./dist/` directory.

To preview the build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deployment

Deployment is automated through GitHub Actions when changes are merged into the `main` branch. The workflow:

1. Builds the site
2. Deploys to the `gh-pages` branch
3. Makes the site available at the configured domain
